#### Next.js 15 Implementation

- Clean App Router integration
- Proper client/server component separation
- Room for additional static optimization
- Opportunity for enhanced loading states

## Implementation Analysis

### 1. Buffer Pool System

The `WavePlayerBufferPool` class implements an efficient memory management system:

```typescript
export class WavePlayerBufferPool {
  private pool: WavePlayerBufferPoolState;
  private chunkSize: number;
  private abortController: AbortController | null = null;

  constructor(options: WavePlayerBufferPoolOptions = {}) {
    this.chunkSize = options.chunkSize || 1024 * 1024; // 1MB default
    this.pool = {
      current: null,
      next: null,
      chunks: new Map(),
      maxPoolSize: options.maxPoolSize || 100 * 1024 * 1024, // 100MB default
      onProgress: options.onProgress,
      onError: options.onError,
    };
  }

  // Efficient chunked loading with proper memory management
  async loadTrackChunked(track: WavePlayerTrack, audioContext: AudioContext) {
    // Implementation details...
  }

  private managePoolSize(): void {
    // Proper memory management implementation...
  }
}
```

### 2. State Management

The system uses a well-structured context and reducer pattern:

```typescript
export type WavePlayerState = {
  audioContext: AudioContext | null;
  status: WavePlayerStatus;
  playlist: WavePlayerPlaylist | null;
  currentTrackIndex: number;
  track: WavePlayerTrack | null;
  buffer: AudioBuffer | null;
  bufferProgress: number;
  currentTime: number;
  startTime: number;
  duration: number;
  volume: number;
  visualization: WavePlayerVisualization;
  isMuted: boolean;
  isLooping: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
};

// Clear action types for state updates
export type WavePlayerAction =
  | { type: "INITIALIZE"; payload: { audioContext: AudioContext } }
  | { type: "SET_BUFFER"; payload: AudioBuffer | null }
  | { type: "SET_TRACK"; payload: WavePlayerTrack | null }
  // ... additional actions
```

### 3. Component Architecture

The system is composed of well-organized components:

```typescript
export default function WavePlayer() {
  const { state, initialize, retryLoad, controls } = useWavePlayer();
  const [needsActivation, setNeedsActivation] = useState(true);

  // Proper initialization and cleanup
  useEffect(() => {
    if (needsActivation && state.status === "idle") {
      initialize();
      setNeedsActivation(false);
    }
  }, [state.status, needsActivation, initialize]);

  // Clean error handling
  if (state.error) {
    return (
      <Card className="wave-player aspect-[5/7] w-full sm:w-[320px] md:w-[360px] flex flex-col border">
        {/* Error UI implementation */}
      </Card>
    );
  }

  // Proper loading states
  if (!state.track || state.status === "loading") {
    return (
      <Card className="wave-player aspect-[5/7] w-full sm:w-[320px] md:w-[360px] flex flex-col border border-primary rounded-none">
        {/* Loading UI implementation */}
      </Card>
    );
  }

  return (
    <Card className="wave-player aspect-[5/7] w-full sm:w-[320px] md:w-[360px] flex flex-col border rounded-none">
      {/* Main player UI */}
    </Card>
  );
}
```
