# WavePlayer - Code Review & Design Document

## Overview

WavePlayer is a React 19 & Web Audio API-based music player system built for Next.js 15. The system aims to provide a modern, component-based audio player with visualization capabilities and playlist management.

## Current Implementation Review

### Architecture

The current implementation follows a well-structured pattern with:

- Context-based state management (`WavePlayerContext`)
- Custom hooks for business logic (`useWavePlayer`)
- Modular UI components
- TypeScript for type safety

#### Strengths

1. **Type System**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript types for player state, tracks, and playlists
   - Clear interface definitions for context values and controls
   - Good separation of concerns in type definitions

2. **Component Structure**
   - Clean separation between visual components
   - Modular design with separate track info, controls, and visualization
   - Use of modern UI components (Radix UI)

3. **Context Design**
   - Well-organized audio context initialization
   - Proper cleanup handling
   - Good state management structure

#### Areas for Improvement

1. **Audio Processing**
   - Need to implement core audio playback functionality
   - Missing buffer loading and management
   - Incomplete audio node connection chain

2. **Controls Implementation**
   - Control functions are currently empty placeholders
   - Need to implement play, pause, seek, etc.
   - Volume control and muting not implemented

3. **Error Handling**
   - Basic error state exists but needs more comprehensive handling
   - Missing retry mechanisms
   - Could use more detailed error states

## Recommended Design & Implementation

### 1. Audio Processing Pipeline

```typescript
// Recommended audio node chain:
AudioBufferSourceNode -> AnalyserNode -> GainNode -> AudioContext.destination
```

Key improvements:

- Add buffer loading and caching system
- Implement proper audio node reconnection on track change
- Add audio buffer preloading for next track

### 2. State Management

Current state management is good but could be enhanced with:

- Track loading states
- Buffer caching states
- More granular error states
- Progress tracking improvements

### 3. Core Features to Implement

#### Playback Control

```typescript
const play = async () => {
  if (!audioContext || !sourceNode) return;
  await audioContext.resume();
  sourceNode.start(0, currentTime);
  setState(prev => ({ ...prev, status: "playing" }));
};

const pause = () => {
  if (!audioContext) return;
  audioContext.suspend();
  setState(prev => ({ ...prev, status: "paused" }));
};
```

#### Track Loading

```typescript
const loadTrack = async (track: WavePlayerTrack) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(track.src);
    const arrayBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
    const audioBuffer = await audioContext.decodeAudioData(arrayBuffer);
    // Setup source node with buffer
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle loading error
  }
};
```

#### Seeking & Time Management

- Implement precise seeking using `AudioBufferSourceNode`
- Track current time with high precision
- Handle loop points correctly

### 4. Performance Optimizations

1. **Buffer Management**

- Implement buffer caching
- Preload next track
- Clear old buffers when memory pressure is high

2. **Rendering Optimization**

- Use `React.memo` for heavy components
- Optimize visualization renders
- Batch state updates

### 5. Future Enhancements

1. **Visualization Options**

- Waveform display
- Frequency visualization
- 3D scene integration

2. **Advanced Features**

- Equalizer
- Time stretching
- Pitch shifting
- Playlist management
- Shuffle/repeat modes

3. **Progressive Enhancement**

- Offline support
- Background playback
- Media session API integration

## Implementation Priorities

1. Core Audio Functionality
   - Complete playback controls
   - Buffer loading system
   - Basic time tracking

2. State Management
   - Error handling
   - Loading states
   - Progress tracking

3. UI Polish
   - Smooth transitions
   - Loading indicators
   - Error states

4. Advanced Features
   - Visualization
   - Playlist management
   - Audio effects

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests
   - Audio context initialization
   - State management
   - Control functions

2. Integration Tests
   - Full playback cycle
   - Track switching
   - Error recovery

3. Performance Tests
   - Memory usage
   - Buffer loading
   - UI responsiveness

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation but requires completion of core audio functionality. The architecture is well-structured and maintainable, making it a good base for building out the complete feature set. Focus should be on implementing the core audio processing pipeline and playback controls before moving on to advanced features.
