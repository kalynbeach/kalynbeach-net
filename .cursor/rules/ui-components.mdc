This project uses **shadcn/ui** for its UI components. These components are located in `components/ui/` and are the UI primatives we can build with.

- Reuse existing UI components from `components/ui/`
- Ask the user how they want to proceed when there are missing components and designs
- Create new components by orchestrating UI components if you can't find any existing components that solve the problem
