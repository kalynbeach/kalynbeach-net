# `kalynbeach-net` Project

This document outlines background context and rules to follow when working on the `kalynbeach-net` project.

## Overview

`kalynbeach-net` is Kalyn Beach's web headquarters. At its core, it is a Next.js application with public and protected routes, and it serves as the foundation for my presence on the web.

The public side serves as my personal website, including my portfolio and any other work or creations I want to share with the world.

The protected side of the app serves two purposes:
- **Admin Routes**: Pages and APIs only accessible by me (the `admin` user)
- **VIP Routes**: Pages and APIs only accessible by `vip` users and the `admin` user
