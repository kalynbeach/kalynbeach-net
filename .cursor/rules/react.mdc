**General**
- Use React 19 (latest) by default
- Use React Compiler
- Always use React's best practices

**Components**
- Components are located in `components/`
- Declare components with `function` instead of `const` (unless there is a specific reason to use `const`)

**Hooks**
- Hooks are located in `hooks/`

**Contexts**
- Use React 19's `use` API when necessary
